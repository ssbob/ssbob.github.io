This is a bit of a short post, quick question/thought on job changes, when is it time, and a brief update on the MBA program.

## When is it an appropriate time to change jobs?

Besides the normal, "when you get bored", or "when you are not challenged" answers, I often want to know when is it considered "timely" to change not just jobs but perhaps careers, or companies? Reason I ask, myself if I am the only one reading this, is I am seeing a lot of peers moving on when they seemed happy. Do they know something I don't know? Or perhaps they were just looking for a change in scenery. I did read an interesting tweet the other day, that said yearly, you should be looking for a new job, even if you are happy. Two things can come from this, either you get practice with interviews and resume updates, or you find a better job. Really, a win-win if you ask me, and I really do think this is correct thinking.

So, I am taking this thinking to heart and practicing, figure it's a good thing and maybe I will find something out there, or worst case, it will help me update my resume (aka my LinkedIn feed).

## MBA program updates

If I didn't already say, I am starting a professional MBA program this fall, and am getting really excited. It's been about 10 years since I was at school, and I am starting to miss that lifestyle. I did my undergrad with a full time job and a family, so this time around I don't have young kids, which is good for them as there are very real time demands that can hurt the family at times. We had an initial virtual meeting to go over some prep work they want us to do, so I guess you could call this pre-homework? I will update again as we get closer, should be interesting and allow me to better formulate my thoughts. 

That's pretty much it, until next time.
